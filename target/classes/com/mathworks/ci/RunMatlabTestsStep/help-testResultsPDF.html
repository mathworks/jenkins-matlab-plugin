Generate a test report in PDF format. By default, MATLAB names the artifact <b>testreport.pdf</b> and stores it in the <b>matlabTestArtifacts</b> folder of the project workspace. 
To override the default artifact name and location, specify a path relative to the project folder in the <b>File path</b> box. If the text box is empty, MATLAB does not generate an artifact.

Due to Jenkins Content Security Policy rules, the generated report might not open properly from within the Jenkins workspace. 
Consider copying the report to a location outside the workspace and opening it from there. For more information,
