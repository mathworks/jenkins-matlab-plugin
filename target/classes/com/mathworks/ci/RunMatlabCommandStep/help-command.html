 Insert the MATLAB commands you want to execute in the <b>Command</b> box. If you need to specify more than one command, use a comma or semicolon to separate the commands.<br>
 <b>Example: </b>results = runtests, assertSuccess(results);<br><br>
 If you need to specify several MATLAB commands, consider writing a MATLAB script or function and executing this script or function instead. (To run a script or function, do not specify the file extension.)<br>
 <b>Example: </b>myscript<br>
 <br>&nbsp;</br>
 <b>Note:</b><ul><li>The build fails if the execution of any command results in an error.</li>
 <li>If the build uses a MATLAB version prior to R2020a, MATLAB might display non-ASCII characters, specified in the <b>Command</b> box, as garbled text. If you specify non-ASCII characters in your commands, consider running your commands as a .m or .mlx file created in the same locale that MATLAB uses on the build agent</li>
 </ul>
