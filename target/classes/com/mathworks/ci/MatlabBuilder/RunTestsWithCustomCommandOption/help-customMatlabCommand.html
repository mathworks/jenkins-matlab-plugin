 To run your tests, enter MATLAB commands separated by semicolons.<br>
 <b>Example:</b> cd c:\MATLAB\tests; runtests('IncludingSubfolder','true');<br>
 
 <br>&nbsp;</br>
 <b>Recommendation:</b>If you require a number of MATLAB commands to execute your build, consider writing a MATLAB script and executing the script file instead.<br>
 <b>Note:</b> The build will fail if the execution of any MATLAB command causes an error.
